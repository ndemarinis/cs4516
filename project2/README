Compilation Instructions

This archive contains source files for the TinyOS demonstration,
AntiTheft.  This application demonstrates TinyOS programming
techniques by signalling light sensor state changes between two motes,
displaying debugging information on an attached computer via the
builtin serial interface.  For convenience, a Makefile has been
provided that integrates with the existing TinyOS toolchain to compile
and load this application.

	To compile the given source, simply run:  
		make telosb

	To load the compiled binaries to the RED mote, install the source with:  
		make telosb reinstall,0
	Similarly, to load the source for the GREEN mote, run
		make telosb reinstall,1
	
	Finally, to watch the serial output from the RED mote (on the dev VM), run:  
		java TheftSerial -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telos

Implementation Details

At present, all components of this design function as specified to the
best of our understanding.  
	- Both motes sample the PSR sensors at their specified
intervals and broadcast a message indicating that their light sensors
have changed state.
	- The red mote communicates with a connected terminal via the
serial over USB interface.  This provides information about the state
changes of both motes and stores a queue of this information for one
minute.  On each interval, the data is cleared and a summary of the
state changes is printed to the console.  Note that due to limited
mote availability, the serial interface was only tested with a single
sensor.  Given the differences between the two sensor implementations,
this should not pose a problem.
