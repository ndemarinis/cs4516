Compilation Instructions

This archive contains source files for the TinyOS demonstration,
AntiTheft.  This application demonstrates TinyOS programming
techniques by signalling light sensor state changes between two motes,
displaying debugging information on an attached computer via the
builtin serial interface.  For convenience, a Makefile has been
provided that integrates with the existing TinyOS toolchain to compile
and load this application.

	To compile the given source, simply run:  
		make telosb

	To load the compiled binaries to the RED mote, install the source with:  
		make telosb reinstall,0
	Similarly, to load the source for the GREEN mote, run
		make telosb reinstall,1
	
	Finally, to watch the serial output from the RED mote (on the dev VM), run:  
		java TheftSerial -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telos
