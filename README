Compilation Instructions

This archive contains source files for the Disaster Identification
Database (DID) client and server.  For convenience, a Makefile has
been provided; to build the client and server, which compile to
did_client and did_server, respectively, simply run `make`.  To build
these binaries with debugging symbols and print statements, run `make
test` (after running `make clean`, if the binaries have already been
compiled).  In addition, two simple tests of the layer stack and a
test server have been provided for demonstration purposes.  To build
these binaries, which compile to test_did_server, echo_client_test,
and picture_client_test, respectively, simply run `make tests`.

The server test binary can be invoked as is with no command line
arguments; the client binary can be invoked as follows:  
  ./did_client <host>

where host is some hostname running the server.  

Client Syntax

As a proof of concept implementation, this application layer for the
DID client and server supports commands with the syntax as defined in
the provided Syntax.txt.

Implementation Details

The following aspects of this impelementation have changed from the design report:  
   - Application Layer
	- Application layer command syntax has been more clearly
	defined.  For details, see Syntax.txt.
	
	- The packet header no longer contains the maximum sequence
	number; as suggested, this was deemed unnecessary.

	- Support for multiple clients is currently nonfunctional.
	While the thread-creation procedures are functional, the application
	layer's methods for string processing in the client and server are 
	not thread-safe.  As such, the maximum number of clients has been
	set to 1.  Given more time, this implementation could be easily 
	refactored for thread-safety.  

  - Layer Stack (Network, DL, Physical Layers)
	- Interlayer communication was handled using pipes between
	each thread, as opposed to the proposed blocking function call
	implementation.  This provides a concurrent, pipelined system between
	the layers.  To avoid the need to use select() or unpredictable
	nonblocking sockets, the network and physical layers are implemented
	as two threads each, one for the sending and receiving component.
	Each thread can then block on its own accord without affecting other
	operations.  The DLL was implemented as a single thread, a counter is
	maintained for the number of bytes in each blocking pipe the DLL must
	read.  When this counter is controlled with a mutex, the DLL thread
	can check if data is available before blocking and act accordingly.  
	
	- Packets and frames are defined as specified in the design
	report, but the number of bytes sent and received is rounded up to the
	number of bytes of the struct created by gcc.  In order to
	keep this implementation simple, the extra 2 or so bytes was deemed 
	an acceptable tradeoff.   As an overlay network created as a proof of 
	concept, the performance loss does not present an issue.  

 	- Frames were originally specified to be transmitted using
	byte stuffing.	As noted in the comments received on the design
	report, this process was deemed unnecessary.  Instead, frames and ACKs
	are always transmitted at their maximum length.  Again, this serves to
	keep the assignment simple:  Linux socket calls and pipes can easily 
	send/receive a specific number of bytes.  While it is specified that 
	Linux file descriptors and sockets can write/read numbers of bytes less
 	than their specified amounts, but this proved dangerously unpredictable
	with the defined pipe implementation.  As the layer stack was developed
	incrementally, this behavior was defined first with the goal of removing
	the restriction before the limitation of the pies could be fully realized.  
	With an expanded timeframe, this implementation could be refactored to
	maximize performance.  However, given the limitations of this proof of
	concept assignment, the padded implementation proved both safe and feasible
	in the given timeframe.  

	- The original design report specification outlined that the network and
	application layers would likely be implemented as a single process.  In this
	implementation, this is partially true, as the application layer forms messages
	directly into packet payloads.  Instead of forming packets from messages, the 
	"network" layer solely handles breaking the packets info frame-payload-sized
	"segments" to be processed by the Data Link Layer.  This may not fulfill the
	true definition of the network layer, but the threads provide a critical layer
	of packet processing for this implementation that would be tedious to handle
	at the application layer.
